      <h2>Re-Emergence of Vector Architectures</h2>

    <p>The commoditization of high performance computing to a
    broader range of applications coupled with the reduction in
    performance improvement from traditional scaling technologies
    has led to a broad interest in a number of new compute
    acceleration technologies from GPGPUs to CGRAs and FPGAs.
    Meanwhile, SIMD widths have been widening to try to keep up
    with computational demand and general purpose architectures
    have started incorporating features from the vector
    architectures that used to dominate high performance computing.
    From IBM's Vector Media eXtension (VMX) to
    NEC's SX architecture to
    Intel's Advanced Vector eXtension (AVX) to
    ARM's recently announced Scalable Vector
    Extension (SVE) -- all of the major general purpose
    architectures seem to have embraced a return to vector based
    functionality.</p>

    <p>Supporting these hardware developments there are a number of
    features being proposed for incorporation into modern
    programming models and languages in order to support the vector
    additions as well as restructuring memory access in order to
    feed the computational pipelines. Meanwhile application
    developers have been hard at work trying to refactor code to
    take advantage of wider vector units and more complicated
    memory hierarchies. Tools and techniques for developing for
    these new vector architectures are still evolving, particularly
    on emerging languages and runtimes.</p>

  <h3><i>Finding Regularity in Problems with Irregularity</i></h3>

  <p><b>Abstract</b></p>
  <p>
Vectorized computation especially on scalar processors with wide SIMD
mechanism requires regularity.  For example, though such a processor
has gather/scatter capability for irregular memory accesses, they are
much less efficient than ordinary consecutive accesses mainly due to,
in speaker's opinion, the line-oriented configuration of caches.
Unfortunately, real HPC programs often have such irregular accesses to
a vector multiplied to a sparse matrix in CRS format, to a linear list
to represent a set of objects, and so on, and thus fail to exploit
SIMD-vector mechanism efficiently.  However, HPC problems (not
programs) with sparse matrices, dynamically configured sets, etc. may
have some degree of regularity because such objects can be represented
in some form with regularity.  In this talk, a few examples in which
regularity is found and exploited are presented to discuss the
importance of programming effort and of the way to reduce the amount
of efforts made by programmers.

  <p><b>Biography:</b></p>
<p>Dr. Hiroshi Nakashima is working in Academic Center for Computing and
Media Studies, Kyoto University as a professor who is responsible for
the design and operation of supercomputers in the Center and for
collaborative HPC researches with the supercomputers.  Prior to join
in the Center, he had been a professor of Toyohashi University of
Technology, an associate professor of Kyoto University, and a
researcher in Mitsubishi Electric Corporation.  He received his B.E.,
M.E. and PhD from Kyoto University in 1979, 1981 and 1991,
  respectively.</p>
